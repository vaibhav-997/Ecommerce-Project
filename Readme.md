# Ecommerce Project

## Description

This Ecommerce Project is a comprehensive solution with authentication features, catering to both admin and regular user functionalities. The project encompasses features such as product management (add, update, and delete) for admins and a seamless shopping experience for regular users.

## Technologies Used

- **Token Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and efficient user authentication.
- **Image Handling**: Utilizes Multer for image upload and Cloudinary for cloud-based image storage.
- **Database**: MongoDB is employed as the database for efficient data storage.
- **Frontend**: Developed using React with libraries including React Router, Redux Toolkit, Shadcn UI, and Dev UI for modular and responsive user interfaces.
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js is chosen for the backend framework to handle server-side operations.
- **Testing**: Postman is used for testing API routes, ensuring the reliability of the backend.

## Features

- **Theme**: Basic dark and light theme implementation.
- **Different Views**: Implements different views for admins and normal users.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures a secure authentication process using JWT tokens.
- **Admin Functionality**: Admins can seamlessly add, update, and delete products.
- **Product Management**: Efficiently manage product details, including images, for an enhanced user experience.
- **Responsive UI**: Utilizes Shadcn UI and Dev UI for creating a visually appealing and responsive frontend.
- **Database Integration**: MongoDB integration ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- **State Management**: Implements Redux Toolkit for effective state management in the frontend.

## Improvements and Missing Features

- **Add to Cart Functionality**: The project currently lacks an "Add to Cart" functionality. Consider implementing this feature for a more complete shopping experience.
  
- **Mobile Optimization**: The mobile responsiveness of the UI can be improved. Ensure a seamless user experience on various devices by optimizing the layout for smaller screens.

## About Me

I'm passionate about full-stack development with a focus on backend technologies. While my expertise lies in backend development, I'm actively working to enhance my frontend skills to become a well-rounded developer. This project is a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and improvement.

## How to Use

- Download the code, run the command `npm install`, and then start the server. For the backend, run the command `npm run start`, and for the frontend, run the command `npm run dev`.
- For a normal user, just register a user and then log in using the email or username with the correct password.
- For an admin user, manually set the role of the user to ADMIN in the database. Make sure that you spell it right.
